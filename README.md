# Restaurant Recommender
This my final personal project on the CodeOp bootcamp. On this project I had 2 main goals:
* Create a restaurant recommendator to a client.
* Create a list of recommendations to a restaurateur
based on the Yelp dataframe.

The problem with this project is that the main data is too big to the share using github, so in order to reproduce this project it is necesary to download and clean the Yelp dataset.
